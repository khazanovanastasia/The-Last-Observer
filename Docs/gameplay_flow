# Gameplay Flow — The Last Observer

## Core Loop

1. The player sits in the center control room (panopticon).
2. The player monitors camera feeds to track enemy movement.
3. Using the blueprint, the player tries to understand the building layout.
4. The player closes one of five doors to prevent NPC entry.
5. Story cues occur through the phone system.
6. NPCs approach the center room.
7. The player survives until the timer ends — or dies.
