# Narrative Concept — The Last Observer

The game explores themes of:
- isolation
- pressure under observation
- epistemic uncertainty 
- the collapse of trust in information sources ??

The player is:
- Alone in a surveillance center
- Receiving calls that slowly degrade
- Watching enemies move through a structure they do not fully know

The system is designed to feel oppressive — the player cannot move.
Information is both their only weapon and a source of anxiety.
